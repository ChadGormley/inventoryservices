# Inventory Services

## Getting Started
The following Spring Boot application was created to service the "that care app" application.

#Java
Version 11 (I know...it should be updated to Java 17)

#Database
H2 (in memory) database

#Notes
Before starting the application locally, be sure to run Mavan "clean" and "compile" jobs.
This will create the VehicleMapperImpl.java class in the "generated-source" folder.
